      commentary:
        If you're wondering what a "Creative Concept" is, don't worry, there's nothing to understand here!
        <code>Scaffolding::AbsolutelyAbstract::CreativeConcept</code> is a model that exists by default in Bullet Train to serve as part of Super Scaffolding's template system.
        It also provides an example of what a scaffolded model looks like by default.
        Yes, the class has a very weird name, but the weird name serves an important purpose when we're generating code.
        For more details and instructions on how to hide this, see "<a href="https://bullettrain.co/docs/super-scaffolding">Code Generation with Super Scaffolding</a>".
